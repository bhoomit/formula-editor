/*  Note: childRoutes can be chunked or otherwise loaded programmatically
    using getChildRoutes with the following signature:

    getChildRoutes (location, cb) {
      require.ensure([], (require) => {
<<<<<<< bab3f0d783601428cc37a3ed389308d42cc3cb39
        cb(null, [
          // Remove imports!
          require('./Counter').default(store)
=======
        next(null, [
          // Provide store for async reducers and middleware
>>>>>>> chore(demo): remove demo code for clean project
        ])
      })
    }

    However, this is not necessary for code-splitting! It simply provides
    an API for async route definitions. Your code splitting should occur
    inside the route `getComponent` function, since it is only invoked
    when the route exists and matches.
